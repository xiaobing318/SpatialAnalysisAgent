# Case Studies

The case studies demonstrate the capabilities of the Spatial Analysis Agent (GIS Copilot) across three levels:

1. Basic level: At this level, the tasks are straightforward, involving a single tool along with one (or occasionally two) data layers. The agent is expected to perform a straightforward operation that usually requires a single step, such as calculating the area of polygons or selecting features based on attributes.
2. Intermediate level : At this level, tasks become more complex and involve multiple steps and tools. The agent is guided with specific instructions or a list of steps to perform the task. Although the steps are outlined, the agent still needs to generate the correct code for each step and link them together to perform the analysis.
3. Advanced level : In the advanced level, tasks are multistep, and the agent is expected to determine the appropriate steps independently without explicit instructions, to devise the best approach for achieving the desired outcome.Evaluates the agent's ability to select the appropriate tool, generate the correct code, and successfully execute the complete operation.

案例研究展示了空间分析代理 (GIS Copilot) 在三个层面上的功能：

1. 基础级别：在此级别，任务很简单，涉及一个工具以及一个（有时是两个）数据层。代理需要执行通常只需一个步骤的简单操作，例如计算多边形的面积或根据属性选择特征。
2. 中级级别：在此级别，任务变得更加复杂，涉及多个步骤和工具。代理需要通过特定说明或步骤列表来指导执行任务。尽管已概述了步骤，但代理仍需要为每个步骤生成正确的代码并将它们链接在一起以执行分析。
3. 高级级别：在高级级别，任务是多步骤的，代理需要在没有明确说明的情况下独立确定适当的步骤，以设计出实现预期结果的最佳方法。评估代理选择适当工具、生成正确代码和成功执行完整操作的能力。

### Case 1.5: Please highlight the largest county and the smalest county in South Carolina.

## Level 2: Intermediate level

### Case 2.1: Perform the following task: 1) Clip the DEM to SC boundary and load the clipped DEM. 2) Show me the histogram for the clipped DEM pixel values. 3) Generate the zonal statistics for every county in SC, focusing on average elevation. 4) Finally create a choropleth map showing the average elevation of each county in SC.

### Case 2.2: Merge the four DEMs into a single raster and perform terrain characteristic analysis for Richland County, including slope, aspect, hillshade, terrain ruggedness index (TRI), and topographic Position Index (TPI).

### Case 2.3: Generate an obesity risk behavior index of each county in the contiguous US by analyzing the rate of visits to unhealthy food retailers (such as convenience store, alcoholic drinking places, and limited service restaurant) and the visit rate to places that support physical activity (e.g., sports centers, parks, fitness centers). Visualize the results in a thematic map to highlight the obesity risk behavior index across counties.

## Level 3: Advanced level

### Case 3.1: Could you analyze and visualize the fast food accessibility score for each county based on the number of fast food restaurants and population using a thematic map with blue graduated colors. Then, analyze the correlation between the county-level obesity rate and the fast food accessibility score by drawing a scatter plot with a regression line.

### Case 3.2: Could you show the spatial distribution of the COVID-19 cases across US counties?

### Case 3.3: Generate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Akure from these satellite imageries.
